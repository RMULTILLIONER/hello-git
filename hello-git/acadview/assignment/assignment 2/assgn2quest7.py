#Does interpreted language get compiled
print("IN SHORT --YES ! IT CAN. SOMETIMES WE NEED IT ,SOMETIMES UNNESSARY \n explanation \n  ")
print("Imagine you only speak English and your friend only speaks French. You write him a letter, in English, and ask a bilingual person to translate it for you.He asks, would you like me to bring the English letter to your friend, stand next to him, and translate it to him one sentence at a time? Or would you like me to translate the whole thing into French now and then send him the translation?Interpreting is similar to the real-time, sentence-by-sentence translation; compiling is more like the whole, ahead-of-time translation. \n Some sort of translation needs to happen, because we program in languages that are convenient for humans but useless to computers. For computers to be able to understand them, then need to be translated, via interpreting or compiling.  if you want your program to run on multiple platforms, you have to compile multiple versions.Whereas you run interpreted code on any computer than has an interpreter. but this lags some speed")
